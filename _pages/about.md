Hey! This is Ayush!

I am Post-doctoral student at IISER Tirupati in the department of mathematics. Prior to joining IISER Tirupati, I was doctoral student at IIT Gandhinagar in the discipline of mathematics, working with [Prof. Sanjay Amrutiya](https://sites.google.com/site/amrutsanj). My research interestes lie in "Vector bundles and related topics".
Specifically, I am interested in moduli spaces, Gauge theory, Parabolic bundles.
